    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich layers of pasta, savory meat 
        or vegetable fillings, creamy bechamel sauce, and melted cheese, often mozzarella 
        and Parmesan. Each layer is carefully stacked, creating a hearty and satisfying 
        meal that is baked to perfection, resulting in a golden, bubbly top. 
        This versatile dish can be customized with a variety of ingredients, such as 
        ricotta cheese, spinach, mushrooms, or a robust meat sauce, making it a beloved 
        favorite at family gatherings and celebrations. Lasagna's comforting flavors and 
        textures have made it a staple in Italian cuisine and popular around the world.</p>
